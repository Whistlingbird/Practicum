# Selecting a Well Location
A mining company needs to decide where to drill a new well.

Oil samples are provided in three regions: each with 10,000 fields, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves were measured. It is necessary to build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where production will bring the greatest profit, analyze the possible profit and risks using Bootstrap technology.

Steps for choosing a location:
- find fields in the selected region, determine the values ​​of the features for each;
- build a model and estimate the volume of reserves;
- select fields with the highest estimated values. The number of fields depends on the company's budget and the cost of developing one well;
- calculate the profit as the total profit of the selected fields.
